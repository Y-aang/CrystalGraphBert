## Install and Data

### 1. Install and Dependancy

Just download the imported package in the `.py` and `.ipynb`.

### 2. Data Processing

Download the traning dataset locally, and run the script in `dataProcess.ipynb`. (Remember to modify your path of data, which in noticed by TODO in  `dataProcess.ipynb`)

### 3. Train

```python
cd model
python train.py
```

Remember to modify your path of data, which in noticed by TODO in `train.ipynb`.

## Result

| Model \ Dataset  | Water Splitting |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
